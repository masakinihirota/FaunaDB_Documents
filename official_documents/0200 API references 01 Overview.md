# API references

This section provides reference material for the two APIs
that you can use to interact with Fauna:

-   [FQL: The Fauna Query Language](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/) - the native API for querying Fauna.
    
-   [GraphQL](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/graphql/) - a database-agnostic API for defining schemas and executing queries and mutations of data within Fauna.
    

See [Limits](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/limits) for document size, transaction size, and concurrent index builds limits.
